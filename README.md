## Weather Project

This project has been created by a student at Parsity, an online software engineering course. The work in this repository is wholly of the student based on a sample starter project that can be accessed by looking at the repository that this project forks.

If you have any questions about this project or the program in general, visit [parsity.io](https://parsity.io/) or email hello@parsity.io.

This app uses React, NextJS and Redux Toolkit to enable a user to search for name of any location by city or country (if searching by city and state, be sure that the country is included as well) and receive a five-day summary chart for temperature, pressure, and humidity.

Sparklines-react is used to render charts.

Weather data for additional cities are rendered successively as the user continues to search for additioanl locations.
